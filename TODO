This document is a high level list of things I have to do.
Low level TODO items are marked in the code as 
#TODO: <do something>
============================================================

-Document every method and class with short statements.
	
-Make the Admin detect a draw.  While it is not very common for a game to end
	in a draw. it IS theoretically possible.
  	
-Make a flash port of the core code and write a UI in flash.  
 	This would be really sweet if the flash code could connect to the ruby server.
 	
-Write a GUI in FXRuby
	-Users should be able to customize and build their own boards. 
	-Host Network Game should be a Wizard. At the end, it should have a checkbox 
		saying "Join the game" and have a text box for the player's name and 
		maybe a combo box of preferred colors.
	-Join a network game
	-User Preferences should be saved and loaded. They're nothing right now.
        -There should be a chat window somewhere	


-Write tests for 
        -Write more full game scenarios
        GetQuotes - not getting the same resource for want and give 4 Wheat for 1 Wheat
        		  - not getting 4:1 for resources you don't want
        Adding more settlements than you have pieces for
        -A turn that plays the road building card, then ends the turn before the roads are placed.
		-Admin.get_player_piece
		-when you move the bandit, you should also select a player to take a card from.
		-in randomize! in board, it was using the same port multiple times 
		     Write a test to ensure that each port in the game are different objects
		-Observers - make sure that the methods are returning the correct types of objects (PlayerInfo)
	Accepting invalid quotes that weren't given to you or when you don't have enough cards.
   	-longest road should be broken up with a settlemtn.
    Roll a 7 and Don't move the bandit, end the turn, it should raise an exception
    
   
-Make the Admin able to handle rule variations

-Make selecting cards to discard, use drag and drop

-Should Resource Hexes be their own classes?
  Differences:
  	resource types
  	random/static resources tiles
  	deserts shouldn't have :get_cards
  	expansions will have different values for get 2 cards
  	  -should there be different classes for the expansion packs?
  	  
  ANSWER: No, The only differences are the types of cards that get returned.  
  There aren't any real differences in functionality.
  
  
I don't think PlayerInfo is useful anymore.  I was using it to pass around safe
user info (info that wouldn't let other players cheat), but now it's just a way
to identify a user.  So, maybe I should just pass around playername as a unique 
identifier.  Or better yet, have the admin generate a player ID int, and send that around.
That way, players could change their names without affecting the game.

    BUGS   
============
Maybe have a different way of showing what was rolled in the gui.
-I didn't pick up on a 9.  Something was wrong.


Bot not finishing turn
Q rolled a 6
Q recieved cards
Then, hang
Everybody had 2 points


Sometimes, the card selection dialog won't let me increase the number of cards
oops, it let me use the controls, but only after a minute.  like it was busy processing
something else.  Then, it crashed with a segmentation fault.


Something is definately wrong with the card selection dialog.  I can select cards
from it, hit ok. And nothing ever happens.
I think when I click on the dialog, it's trying to update the main gui frame.  maybe because it's modal?
I'm not sure.
