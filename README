Ruby Settlers
=============

	Ruby Settlers is a implementation of the popular board game,
Settlers of Catan.  It is written in ruby and is intended to run as a
standalone application or an online, multiplayer game.




Playing the Game!
------------------------
This is the main application.  From here, you can start single player games and  
start/join multiplayer games.
Use this command:
	ruby bin/rubysettlers.rb

	

Starting a Server
-----------------
To start a server for a single game, use this command:
	ruby server.rb



Running the Test Suite
----------------------
There is an extensive collection of unit, integration, and stress
tests.  They can be found in the $project_root$/tests directory.  To
run them all, use this command:
	
	ruby tests/all_tests.rb

Individual test suites are kept in files named <name>_tests.rb.  To
run these files separately, use this command:

	ruby tests\<name>_tests.rb

	
	
	
System Requirements
-------------------
Running from source:
	You can run the app inside the standard ruby interpreter and for that, 
	you'll need Ruby and FXRuby

	Ruby - The standard ruby can be installed from www.ruby-lang.org
	FXRuby - is the Ruby bridge to the FOX GUI toolkit.  If you have RubyGems 
			 installed you can just run the command: 
			 	gem install fxruby
			 	
On Windows, you can just run the rubysettlers.exe.  But, it's just a "compiled" 
version of the ruby code.
